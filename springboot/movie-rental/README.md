Homework - SpringBoot HW

Notes:
I had a hard time understanding the UDEMY, which led me to look for more online sources than usual. I think the 
hardest part was switching back into the API mindset. It took about three days for me to remember the dummyAPI
and how it worked. Once I made the connection between DummyAPI and the getComments, PostComments etc. my project 
pretty much fell together. Now I feel like with that connection made I understood what was going on in the UDEMY 
videos.
