Homework - Java Exercises

Exercise 1:
    My blocker with exercise one was starting without understanding the syntax of Java. After a couple of days with 
the UDEMY I was able to see how loops are still loops in java. I used  W# schools to understand while loops and 
try catch statements. 

Exercise 2:
    My blocker was trying to conceptualize how to switch from math to matching characters in a string. It took me a 
few days to wrap my head around hashmaps and what it does, what a key is, and how to loop through both. But with 
a pre-lecture explanation from Abigail and Abram I was able to understand it much better. I feel like with an output
photo, I would have been able to understand the pseudocode provided better. 

Exercise 3:
    I was blocked by my lack of knowledge of math. I didn't understand what a factor was or really what get the count
of two's meant. Once I saw the factor tree and the circled twos the assignment made more conceptual sense. With help
from Dylan(you), I was able to get it coding wise. Now looking back on the code I am able to see the relationships 
between the classes and which classes are passing data. However, this assignment was very difficult to understand how 
to conceptualize the request and how to implement those concepts into code. 

Exercise 4:
    I found this assignment difficult because I didn't understand how it was chutes and ladders. I definitely only 
began understanding how to code this when I went through step by step and broke down what I need to do. Step one being 
make the board, step two go to main and get the board to show in the console etc. It was hard because I couldn't seem
to get the big ask broken into small steps. 

Exercise 5:
    My biggest blocker was testing. I found the exercise to be like 5 of the number aggregators with a bit of the 
factor by two recursion, and the multiple loops from the grid hopper. I felt like it was a lot of steps but the steps
were easily discoverable, and I think it's because I knew what the output should be.
