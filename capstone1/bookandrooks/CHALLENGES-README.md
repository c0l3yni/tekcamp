Capstone 1

My biggest challenge with this assignment was the amount of moving parts. It was difficult to manage my running to do list due to the amount of steps needed to be completed for this assignment. I think time was a big factor. I wanted to get the website looking like a website while there was a laundry list of functionality to-do's. This made me feel like I was perpetually behind. 

I had a lot of trouble with my shopping cart and managing the different states. It was very difficult for me to understand how to like the quantity in stock to the quantity in cart. I finally found a way to do this by using if/else statements which have become my go to. I think in the future I would like to circle back to the Udemy and rewatch the videos on state, at least before capstone 3. 

I was surprised that I struggled for hours with form validation. I could not get the form to clear and the form to check the input values for a long time. I overcame it by moving to other areas of the project and circling back once or twice a day to see if I could logic it out. 

Overall, the capstone really mentally challenged me. I haven't felt this amount of brain fatigue since my first finals in college. It was exhausting and challenging but I learned so much. I think the presentation is going to be a challenge in and of itself because I have not presented via web in months. I am nervous about presenting not in person but also nervous because it is a new experience. This has brought a lot of new things to me and I am just hoping I can cling on the things I have learned while we shift into java.
