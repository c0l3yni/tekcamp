Homework - Form Validation

I started this assignment before the accordion project. The hardest part was starting. I initialized my project by trying to write one giant function that would complete all of the necessary functionality. I decided to tackle the error message displaying. This allowed me to take the project on in small chunks. 

I did struggle with the regex implementation until I found the below listed resource. I attempted to do an if/else if/else statement for the email verification and check for an empty string but this led me down a rabbit hole of switch statements. I then just used a regex instead. 

I also had issues with the svg exclamation point appearing thicker than the example image. However, was told in office hours to ignore the difference. 

Overall, my main issue was trying to think big picture when I should have started with baby steps.
