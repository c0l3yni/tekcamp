Homework - Accordion

My biggest challenge was getting the accordion to close upon clicking. I solved the issue by creating an if else statement. However, after creating the statement, the function would not run upon initial click. It required two clicks for the initial response and one click after that. I solved this by switching my if/else statements.

In office hours, Abigail shared the w3 schools link that I utilized to make my code more compact. Now it is able to run regardless on off additional questions or answers are added, as long as they are withing the same array. 

I also had issues with my mouse event listener not working inside the click event listener. I solved this  by placing the mouse events outside the click events. 

I essentially wrote the accordion code based off the form validation code. I used if/else statements and wrote eveything out long hand. This allowed me to add the more complex code like the for loop after. Since I already knew my variables were grabbing the correct values it essentially became rewriting the same code, with an additional variable of i, and a few syntactical changes to reduce the code from 100 lines to 30.

Abram and Rami helped me with the accordion closing after opening in a huddle on the help channel on 2/3 around 8 pm.
