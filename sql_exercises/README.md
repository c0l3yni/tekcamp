Homework - SQL HW

I really enjoyed SQL. I think the hardest part was interpretting the requirements. On exercise 5, I oriignally thought we should search for one initial. I ended up moving fairly quickly through exercises 1-8, and then hit a hard block on 9, 10, 11. These were a combination of the skills of the past exercises. I found it pretty hard and it definitely took up most of my time. I think if I were to do all of the exercises over, I would have watched all the UDEMY and then attempted 6 and up. Trying to do the homework while watchign the UDEMY did end up being pretty hard, so in the future I would switch my learning process up. Also, I would definitely ask for more clarification up front rather than completeing the exercises and going back to refactor.
